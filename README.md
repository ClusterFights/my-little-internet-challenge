My Little Internet is a ClusterFights challenge that involves creating our own little internet in the ClusterFights room. 

Competitor nodes participate as Routers supporting the BGP protocol (and whatever other protocols they prefer). Competitor nodes might not be directly connected to one another - they may need to pass through other competitor's nodes to reach their actual node.

Competitors may choose to have their nodes not forward traffic or choose an inefficient route to sabotage their competitors, but they would also be damning themselves. 

The winner is determined by which competitor has handled the most traffic.
